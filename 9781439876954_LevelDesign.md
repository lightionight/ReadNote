## Level Design
* "认为游戏是一种动物与生俱来的天性,是从千万年的动物狩猎生存活动繁衍而来,与其说是游戏,不如说是为生存而练习"
* 我们的大脑可以接受较动物更为复杂的游戏及游戏规则
* aptitude "天资, 天赋"
* linguistics "语言学"
* > We know, for example, that
we can play games with people whose linguistics aren’t ours, whose culture we
don’t share, and whom we have never met before. It is even clear that we can play
games with creatures that don’t even belong to our species!

* subgenre "更近一步, 下一部"
* medchanism "装置, 方法"
* vital "必不可少的"
* rephrasing "换个说法"

* > good level design teaches the player how to play and enjoy the game.
> * the physical rules of the environment. 
> * the abilities of the player's in game character. 
> * the behavior of enemies

* 好的关卡设计应该引导玩家学习游戏操作方式,并提供适度的空间给与玩家自由发挥,并获得快乐.
* > what actions and skills does the player have to master in order to get rewarded by the game? where are the most enjoy sections to be found, which weapons provide the best results, what creatures are most fun to play with, and which skills should the player train first? all these questions present a teaching dialogue between level designer and player
* inappropriate "不合适, 不恰当的"
* sake "理由 , 缘故"
